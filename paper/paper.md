# Summary

Numerical simulations of reacting fluid flows rely on accurate models that
describe chemical kinetics, 

Chemical kinetic models 

pyMARS (or Python-based Model Automatic Reduction Software)

`pymars` relies on the Cantera suite [@cantera] to handle the chemical kinetics
and perform autoignition simulations; it temporarily stores full simulation results
as HDF5 files using PyTables [@pytables].

NetworkX [@networkx_paper; @networkx;]

PyYAML 

NumPy [@vanderWalt2011]


# Example



# Conclusions

In this paper we present the `pymars` software package for reducing chemical
kinetic models.
